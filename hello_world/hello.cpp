#include <iostream> // libraries to include; equiavalent to imports in python

// int main() {  // The function created, in this case the main() function; must have open bracket {
//   // std::cout is the character output stream (cout) pronounces "see-out"; this is how you output to the terminal
//   // << is an operator
//   // Use double quotes ("") around text and the \n as a special character to indicate a new line
//   // Use the ; character to tell the computer that you're at the end of a statement
//   std::cout << "Hello World!\n";  // What the program does

// }  // Closing bracket to indicate the end of a function

// We can output multiple lines by adding more std::cout statements



// int main() {

//     std::cout << "Hello\n";
//     std::cout << "Goodbye\n";  // Notice that we need a ; character at the end of every statement
// }

    std::cout << "   4 5 6\n";
    std::cout << "7 8 9 10\n";
